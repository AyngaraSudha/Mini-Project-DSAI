## Problem Definiton
The goal is to analyze and predict student spending behaviors based on various demographic factors 
<br> such as Year in School(University),Major and Preferred Payment Methods.

Which model would be the best to predict the spending behaviours?

## Models Used
1. Multi Class Classification
2. Random Forest

## Data Preparation and Exploratory Analysis
We grouped similar expenditure coloumns such as personal_care and health_wellness together to facilitate a more 
<br> organised exploratory analysis and to simplify comparisons

## Conclusion 
In conclusion,

## Our Learning Points
- Coloumn Inspection
- Random Forest Regression
- Concepts of F1,Precision,Recall and Support
- Github Collaboration
